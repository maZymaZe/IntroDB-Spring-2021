Topics include: Data models (relational, document, key/value) Storage models (n-ary, decomposition) Query languages (SQL, stored procedures) Storage architectures (heaps, log-structured) Indexing (order preserving trees, hash tables) Transaction processing (ACID, concurrency control) Recovery (logging, checkpoints) Query processing (joins, sorting, aggregation, optimization) Parallel architectures (multi-core, distributed) Homeworks There will be roughly weekly homework. These will generally consist of a number of written problems. Since there are also laboratory classes, these homework will not involve any programming. Important You are welcome to discuss these problems with other students, but this should be limited to discussions of high-level strategies and concepts. The actual write-up of the solutions must be your own. Homeworks needs to be submitted in class Every Tuesday . They can either be handwritten or typed (LATEX is recommended) and print. However, your work must be clear and legible to receive credit. Written solutions will not be posted, but the homework problems may be reviewed in Q&A recitations . Assignments In the first few weeks, there are several simple assignments to help students understand the practicalities of database operation, which are very easy since we will provide detailed instructions. We will post each assignment here in Friday's class , and students are required to complete the work and have it checked by TAs in class . Assignment-1 Projects In this course, students will be required to complete two course projects . Project-1 will be posted after the completion of the first few weeks of assignments and project-2 will be assigned after project-1 . Students will have plenty of time to complete both projects, which will not be too difficult and will focus more on the understanding and application of databases.

This task is an opportunity to: Learn how to launch the database service Get familiar with using a client to connect the database service and perform basic operations, which can be useful for you in the future. Release Date: March 05, 2021 / 15:25 Due Date: March 05, 2021 / 17:10 Quick Start Before setting up a local database in your own computer, you can try with computers in laboratory. In the desktop, you will see a folder named \"\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5f15\u8bba\" Then double click the \"Mysql Workbench.exe\" inside to start the application. You will also see a txt file called \"mysql_password\" , which will be used when connecting. Once you establish connection successfully, you can try this simple task Specification Then you need to install both mysql-server and mysql-client in your own computer. Server Download Address You can come here for reference Hint Please choose the version that corresponds to your operating system Then click the No thanks, just start my download. If you have installed and configured the environment path, you can try the following commands to determine whether the installation is successful $ mysql -u root -p $ mysql> show databases; Client We recommend these two client tools Download address: Hint Please choose the version that corresponds to your operating system Navicat (It's not free) Mysql Workbench the default port will be 3306 Simple task After all the above steps are completed, you are required to do following create a new schema use command CREATE SCHEMA ` intro_db ` ; use client tool Create a new table use command CREATE TABLE ` intro_db ` . ` course ` ( ` id ` INT NOT NULL , ` name ` VARCHAR ( 45 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( ` id ` )); use client tool Insert a new data use command Insert into ` intro_db ` . ` course ` ( id , name ) values ( 2 , 'amy' ); use client tool","title":"Assignment-1"},{"location":"Assignment/assignment1/#assignment-1","text":"","title":"Assignment 1"},{"location":"Assignment/assignment1/#overview","text":"The first assignment is to set up a local database environment and be able to perform basic operations using the client.
